    <div style="position: absolute;">
    <h1 class="colororange">First reason:</h1>
    <p class="colorpurple">It has really good side charecters, <br> if u watch bleach u will memorise <br> and like so many charecters that u will not even <br>be capable of deciding what is your favorite character.<br>For example i can't decide what is my favorite character<br> i am always in between <br>Urahara Kisuke, Toshiro Hitsugaya, Kenpachi Zaraki</p>
    </div>

    <div style="position: absolute;margin-left: 500px;">
        
            <h1 class="colororange">Second reason:</h1>
    <p class="colorgreen">It has the best antagonists in all of anime <br>in this case i am talking about Aizen Souske,<br> and even without him bleach has very good <br>antagonists like, Ulquiorra, Grimmjow and yhwach<br>i say aizen is the best because with him happened<br>one of the best plot twists in all of anime and <br>he did very unexpected things in the anime.</p>

    <div style="position: absolute;margin-left: 1000px;">
        <h1 class="colororange">Third reason:</h1>
    <p class="coloryellow">it has a the best transformations in all of anime and the most transformations probablly i say they are the best because they look really cool and the creator of bleach was really creative with the powers and transformation in the anime and the most because a lot of characters have a bankai/resurrection and each one of them is a transformation </p>
